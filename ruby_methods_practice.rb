#   return number1 - number2
# end

# p subtract(10, 5)
# p subtract(20, 13)
# p subtract(1, 24)


# 4. Write a function that takes in a number and returns the number times itself. Then run the function and print the result.

# end

# p times_self(10)
# p times_self(9)
# p times_self(77)
# p times_self(18993001)

# 5. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first letter of the string. Then run the function and print the result.
